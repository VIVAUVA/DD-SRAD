# DD-SRAD

# DD-SRAD stands for Distance Driven Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion for denoising 
# SAR temporal stacks.

# This code is written for use with MATLAB. Is used for denoising of temporal stacks of 
# synthetic aperture radar data, but can be used for any image data taken over time that 
# is corrupted by noise. Further details can be found in the associated paper, listed 
# below. Please cite the following if using this code:

# distance-driven anisotropic diffusion of synthetic aperture radar temporal stacks", 
# Digital Signal Processing, vol. 74, pp. 43-55, 2018.

# Two datasets are provided with the code, one synthetically generated, and one set of 
# real SAR amplitude data. The original synthetic data is also included for comparison.
# To run a demo, please run DD_SRAD.m.
